In the project directory, you can run:

<li>
React Router DOM:

 React Router DOM enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. Unlike the traditional routing architecture in which the routing is handled in a configuration outside of a running app, React Router DOM facilitates component-based routing according to the needs of the app and platform. </li>

<li>
Firebase Authentication

 Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.
</li>

<li>
React-Toastify is one of the top React toast libraries available. This tool allows you to add toast notifications to your application with ease and can also be used to set notifications and alerts. </li>

<li>
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License which is deemed non-free by several distributions
</li>

<li>
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. I like to think of it as a cool way to write inline styling and achieve an awesome interface without writing a single line of your own CSS.
</li>

<li>
 Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
